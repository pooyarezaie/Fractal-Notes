# Fractal Notes

**Fractal Notes**  is a mathematical educational website that presents short, intuitive, and sometimes deep notes about mathematics. Just as a fractal emerges from repeating simple patterns at different scales, these notes are small windows into deeper mathematical structures.

## Overview

This project is a Jekyll-based static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is written in Persian and features right-to-left (RTL) layout. It aims to collect ideas, definitions, exercises, and inspiring proofs in a simple and accessible format.

The notes are not meant to replace textbooks, but rather serve as **small sheets of understanding** that each introduce you to a larger topic from a small perspective.
