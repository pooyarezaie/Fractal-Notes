# Fractal Notes

**Fractal Notes**  is a mathematical educational website that presents short, intuitive, and sometimes deep notes about mathematics. Just as a fractal emerges from repeating simple patterns at different scales, these notes are small windows into deeper mathematical structures.

## Overview

This project is a Jekyll-based static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is written in Persian and features right-to-left (RTL) layout. It aims to collect ideas, definitions, exercises, and inspiring proofs in a simple and accessible format.

The notes are not meant to replace textbooks, but rather serve as **small sheets of understanding** that each introduce you to a larger topic from a small perspective.

## Website

🌐 **Live Site**: [fractalnotes.com](https://fractalnotes.com)

## Setup and Development

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** (with Bundler) — required for Jekyll
- **Node.js** (with npm) — required for the prerender step (local pipeline and Docker build)
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional) — for building and running the prerendered site in a container

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pooyarezaie/Fractal-Notes.git
cd Fractal-Notes
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install        # Ruby gems only
make install-deps   # Ruby + Node (needed for prerender)
```

3. Build and serve locally:
```bash
make dev            # Jekyll with livereload at http://localhost:4000
# Or: bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Build and deploy (GitHub Pages)

The repo uses **GitHub Actions** to build and deploy:

1. **Jekyll** builds the site into `_site`.
2. A **prerender** step runs a headless browser (Playwright) on each page so KaTeX and inline JS (tables, nav, lightbox) are already applied in the HTML—no first-load delay.
3. The resulting `_site` is deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Required:** In the repo **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

### Switching between prerendered and default mode

| Mode | Settings → Pages → Source | What you get |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Prerendered** | **GitHub Actions** | Build runs Jekyll + prerender; deployed HTML already has KaTeX and JS applied. No first-load delay. |
| **Default (Jekyll only)** | **Deploy from a branch** → choose branch (e.g. `main`) and folder (e.g. `/ (root)`) | GitHub builds the site with Jekyll only (no prerender). KaTeX runs in the browser after load; you may see a short delay. |

To switch: go to the repo **Settings → Pages**, then change **Source** to either **GitHub Actions** (prerendered) or **Deploy from a branch** (default). After saving, the next deploy will use the chosen mode.

To check if the live site is prerendered, run:

```bash
make check-prerender
# Or with a custom URL: make check-prerender SITE_URL=https://username.github.io/Fractal-Notes
```

To run the full pipeline locally (build + prerender):

```bash
make build-prerender
# Or step by step: make build && make prerender (after make install-node)
# _site now contains prerendered HTML
```

Only pages under the **directories** listed in **`scripts/prerender-whitelist.json`** are prerendered. Use `""` for the site root (homepage only) and directory paths like `"complex-numbers"` or `"problem-solving/symmetry"` to include every HTML page under that path. New markdown files under a whitelisted directory are prerendered automatically; add a new directory to the list to include a new section.

## Docker (Prerendered + Nginx)

The Docker image builds the same **prerendered** site as GitHub Actions (Jekyll → Playwright prerender), then serves it with **Nginx** as static HTML/CSS only—no first-load delay for math or JS.

**Build and run:**

```bash
make docker-build    # Build the image
make docker-up       # Run at http://localhost:8080 (detached)
```

Or with Compose directly:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Other commands:** `make docker-down` (stop), `make docker-logs` (tail logs).

The site will be available at **http://localhost:8080**.

For all available commands (build, prerender, Docker, etc.), run **`make help`**.

## Project docs

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — guide for AI assistants: repository map, the
  step-by-step workflow for adding a note, and the writing/style conventions.
  It's also the quickest orientation for a new human contributor.
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — Claude Code-specific reminders (points to AGENTS.md).
- **[PROJECT_NOTES.md](PROJECT_NOTES.md)** — technical cheat-sheet (Jekyll, KaTeX, build).

## Contributing

This is a personal educational project. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome!

New note in a nutshell: create `<topic>/<name>.md` with `title` + `description`
front matter, write it in the house style, then register it under the right
topic group in `_data/site_index.yml` (and add the directory to
`scripts/prerender-whitelist.json` if it's a new topic). Full checklist in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Notes are organised into **topic groups**, and a group can be marked
`series: true` — an ordered mini-course whose lessons are numbered and get
automatic previous/next navigation plus a landing page (see
[`/complex-numbers/`](https://fractalnotes.com/complex-numbers/)). See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) §5.
